## Create a FIS application component hosted on OpenShift from source code

These steps demonstrate how OpenShift can build and deploy a simple Fuse
Integration Services-based application component from source code.  This would
typically be done by a developer.

1. Create the application component.
   1. Double-click the Terminal icon on the desktop.
   1. Type `oc project xpaas` and press `ENTER`.  You must use the *xpaas*
      project at this point for the rest of the walk-through to proceed!
   1. Type `cd git/fis-examples/cdi-camel-jetty` and press `ENTER`.
   1. Type `mvn -Pf8-local-deploy` and press `ENTER`.  Maven will
      compile the project, package it in a Docker image as a flat Java
      classpath application, and deploy an instance of it to OpenShift.
   1. Type `exit` and press `ENTER` to close the terminal window.
1. Test that the application component is up and running.
   1. Return to Firefox and wait for OpenShift to deploy the application into
      the xpaas project.
   1. Press `CTRL + T` to open a new tab.
   1. Navigate to http://qs-cdi-camel-jetty-xpaas.apps.example.com/camel/hello .
   1. You may see a 503 error while the container is starting, this is because
      this example does not have a readinessProbe defined.  If so, wait a moment
      and retry.
   1. Navigate to http://qs-cdi-camel-jetty-xpaas.apps.example.com/camel/hello?name=yourname
